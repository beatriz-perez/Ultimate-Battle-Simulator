# THE ULTIMATE BATTLE SIMULATOR

## How to play 

In this game, you'll be able to challenge your friends to a Warriors and Wizards battle. First, you'll have to create your party either manually if you want to personalize every aspect of it or either randomly trusting the computer's choice. There are two options to create the party manually: directly inside the game or exporting a CSV file if you already have a winning party you trust saved. 

Once you and your opponent have created the parties, the battle begins. You'll only have to choose the brave fighter who'll fight for the party and its life in a duel against a fighter from your opponent's party. The battle will be by rounds and in each round, each of them will choose an attack automatically depending on their stats. The combat will extend until one of them dies. The losing party will lose the dead fighter, who will be sent to the graveyard. The winner will be sent back to the winning party.

The game will run until one of the parties loses all its members and a winner is declared. The winner then will have the option to export its winner party to a CSV file in case wanting to use it in further games. Then, you'll have to decide either to get revenge or to exit the game. Hope you enjoy it!

**The game is ready to be played, just run the file main and have fun!**
